1.	Point 8b-  “Subcontractor shall not solicit or accept perform any services for the benefit of Client other than as a subcontractor of SilverSearch”. Please have this removed. We are agreeing not to work with client directly, but this clause will restrict us to work with other vendor’s of us who may be the clients of SilverSearch.
2.	Point 8d- Please include the client as well “During the term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement, SilverSearch and their clients shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit, hire or engage any individual who is then or within the twelve (12) months prior thereto was a consultant or employee of Subcontractor.
3.	Point 9- Please remove injunctive relief. Instead you can add a clause which will say “Any remedy for the clause will be decided by court of law”.
4.	Point 11- Please remove the lines “Subcontractor agrees that failure to comply with the proper resignation process will result in the forfeiture of payments of any outstanding invoices”.
